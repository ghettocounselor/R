#Interger - we tell R we're going to need to do math with this variable
x <- 2L   # L tells R to store as an integer so we can do math
typeof(x) # tells us this is an integer

#double - is the default mode of storage for R
y <- 2.5
typeof(y) # tells us this is a double

#complex - complex numbers
z <- 3 +2i
typeof(z)

#character - store letters or text
